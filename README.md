#  BabySittersClub
The Babysitters Club Employment Agency has decided to computerize their payroll. A babysitter earns a specific fee per hour until 9:00 PM (while the children are awake and active), a lower rate between 9:00 PM and midnight (after bedtimes and the babysitter can study), and a higher fee after midnight (when babysitting cuts into prime sleeping time).

They maintain two datafiles are one for the employees and one for their data   

### H3 Personnel data file 

* employee no.
* lastname, firstname
* street address
* city, state zipcode
* hourly rate before 9:00 PM,	hourly rate between 9:00 PM and midnight,	hourly rate after midnight




### Payroll data file
* employee no.
* number of days employed
* starting time and ending time for each day


I wrote a program that reads the starting time and ending times (in hours and minutes) for a babysitter and computes the babysitterâ€™s fee. Assume all times are between 6:00 PM and 6:00 AM.
